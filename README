Description
===========

DeGap is a tool that computes permission gaps. Its core uses a Python plugin
framework and currently has three types of plugins implemented for Sshd, Auditd,
and User Groups. The scripts are found in "scripts/DeGap/".

For Sshd, DeGap uses authorization logs (commonly /var/log/auth.log*) to extract
the SSH access information.

For Auditd and User Groups, they use the same set of auditd logs. In addition,
they require file metadata information. You can run
"scripts/utils/get-file-stats.py" on the subject machine to extract the
information. The script takes in a list of files, and outputs another file with
the metadata containing the following information concatenated with '|'.
1. Full path
2. File extension
3. Number of files in same directory with same extension (currently unused)
4. File type
5. Number of files in same directory with same type (currently unused)
6. File mode
7. File UID
8. File GID

There is also a patch in "src/kernel" that modifies auditd to remove duplicated
auditd entries. Duplicated entries are those that have the same fields that are
required for DeGap to function properly. Fields, such as timestamps, are not
necessary. Removing duplicated entries is not really necessarily for DeGap to
work, but rather for performance improvements.

For User Groups, DeGap also requires the "/etc/passwd" and "/etc/group" files from
the target machine.

Please read the accompanying paper for more information. Note that the tables in
the database may differ. For example, Principal in the database corresponds to
Subject, Operation corresponds to Right, and Resource corresponds to Object.


Prerequisites
=============

I try to list some of the prerequisites that I had to install for my system.
However, your system may have other required components missing.

1. Python 2.7.3 with pyparsing
2. libaudit-dev


Examples
========

[SSHD]
Pre-requisites from target machine:
a. Authorization log files placed in "test/sshd/authlogs/".
b. SSHD configuration file, sshd_config, placed in "test/sshd/".

1. Change directory to "test/sshd".
   > cd test/sshd/

2. Extract only SSHD log records from authorization log files into sshd.log.
   > grep -h "sshd\[[0-9]*\]" authlogs/* > sshd.log

3. Make sure the value for inlog in config.ini is sshd.log.

4. Use DeGap to parse logs. May take a while.
   > ../../scripts/Degap.py parse-logs

5. Use DeGap to load configurations from sshd_config (original target SSHD
   configuration file, e.g. /etc/ssh/sshd_config).
   > ./Degap.py load-configs

6. Use DeGap to compute granted permissions.
   > ./Degap.py compute-grperms

7. Use DeGap to automatically restrict permissions.
   > ./Degap.py restrict-auto
